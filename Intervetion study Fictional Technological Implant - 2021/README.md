# Intervetion study Fictional Technological Implant -  2021

## Study design

- main research questions: (1) verify whether the CAM method can provide additional information vis-à-vis the established data collection method of online surveys within complex topics, (2) check if CAMs are a helpful method in mediation
- longitudinal (time points = 2, one week interval), intervention:
    - participants with a positive pre-CAM were told to elaborate the negative prototype and vice versa. Participants with a neutral pre-CAM (mean valence = 0) got allocated randomly. The elaboration was prompted by two questions which had to be processed for at least two minutes each. Both CAMs, the own CAM from the first measurement time point and the allocated prototype, were visible at the same time. The control group just elaborated their CAM from the first measurement time point
- collection of CAMs and multiple scales ([see scales used](/Intervetion%20study%20Fictional%20Technological%20Implant%20-%202021/scales%20used/overview%20scales.pdf))
- N=90 first time point, N=75 second time point (dropout rate of 16.6 %)
- descreptive: mean age was 32.69 years (SD = 12.14), while ranging from 19 to 72. we had 46 male participants, 28 female and one intersex.

## Abstracts
Dörr (2021):

This exploratory study and the evaluation of qualitative components is part of the Cluster of Excellence Living, Adaptive and Energy Autonomous Material Systems (livMatS) at the Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg. Within this project, material systems of the future will be developed that are meant to combine the best of nature and technology. In order to achieve a successful societal implementation of these, the acceptance of a new and possibly disruptive technology will be investigated before its actual implementation. In order to be able to investigate complex social stances or ideologies regarding a complex topic, a dynamic survey method is necessary. The method of Cognitive-Affective Mapping (CAM) follows a non-dimensional approach and allows for graphical illustration of the complex structure of mental representations.
The present study aims to verify whether the CAM method can provide additional information vis-à-vis the established data collection method of online surveys within complex topics. For this purpose, CAMs were qualitatively evaluated and summarized into concepts. These concepts were then compared with the concepts already mentioned within the questionnaire being used. The results of the qualitative evaluation show that only a few concepts from the questionnaire were mentioned within the CAMs. Most of the concepts of the CAMs came from other parts of the study. In fact three concepts and two sub-concepts could be additionally identified. This study is meant to give impetus to investigating the comparatively new method of CAM as a direct data collection method and to show strength of this method.

Mediation is a method for conflict resolution in which an impartial mediator reconciles the conflicting parties by fostering mutual understanding. A Cognitive-Affective Map (CAM) is a novel concept graph that is able to represent cognitions and affects of somebody’s point of view. CAMedaid is a portmanteau consisting of the words CAM, (to) mediate and (to) aid. It’s meant to express, that CAMs perhaps are a helpful method in mediation. To examine this further, our participants drew a CAM on a controversial topic. A week later, participants who drew a CAM of positive affective connotation at the first measurement time point elaborated a negative CAM and vice versa. After this, the participants drew a second CAM. A control group elaborated their first CAM. In addition, a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model 3 (TAM3) was used to validate our findings. Our first hypothesis could be accepted: The pre-post difference concerning the CAM’s average valence was greater in the experimental group than in the control group. Our second hypothesis could be accepted as well: The pre-post difference concerning the TAM3’s aggregated score was greater in the experimental group than in the control group. This means, that the elaboration of a CAM of opposite affective connotation was able to change the point of view of the participants in our experimental group. The TAM3 questionnaire provided a first hint at the validation of CAMs for the purpose of opinion change. All in all, we highly recommend the further examination of CAMs in mediation.
