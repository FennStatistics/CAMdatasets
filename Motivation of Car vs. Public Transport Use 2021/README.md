Facing the climate crisis, changes in mobility behaviour become necessary, especially a de-crease in car-use. Exploring reasons for the choice of transport means can be a basis for inter-ventions. In response to Andor et al. (2020) this study aimed to replicate the effect of the un-derestimation of the monthly vehicle’s costs. Additionally, other car-related costs and reasons for the underestimation were explored. The effect of information about the actual cost on the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a public transport monthly ticket, the attitudes regarding differ-ent means of transport and the estimation of car-related costs was examined. Furthermore, we wanted to learn, which reasons are relevant for the decision between car and public transport. Car users (N=147) were questioned online in a mixed-method-design containing a question-naire and Cognitive Affective Maps. They were assigned randomly to an intervention or con-trol group. Data was collected before and after the intervention. The underestimation effect of the monthly car costs from Andor et al. (2020) could be replicated. All other car related costs have been underestimated, too. Psychological theories providing possible reasons for this un-derestimation were discussed. The intervention increased the WTP for a public transport ticket and changed the attitudes towards different means of transport. The estimation for the total monthly costs and the monthly depreciation costs improved, the other estimations re-mained the same. It was shown that costs are a crucial factor in the decision between different means of transport. Information about the actual costs of cars could therefore contribute to changing mobility behaviour.
