# Stratospheric Aerosol Injection Multi Method 2022

## Study design

- main research questions: (1) combine newly developed methods consisting of two data collections tools (Cognitive-Affective Mapping and large-scale survey) and three types of data analyses (analyses of Cognitive-Affective Maps, analyses of survey data using factor analysis and cluster analytical procedures) to inform climate policy
    + CAMs were used as a pre-study to inform subsequent survey study (main study); we identified additional ethic scales and climate change concern scale
- longitudinal (time points = 2, two week interval), no intervention
- collection of CAMs and multiple scales 
- N=68 CAMs
- descreptive CAM data: mean age 38, SD = 10.40, 47% female; one participant (2%) faced technical problems, but no one had to stop drawing the CAM for technical reasons

## Abstracts
Fenn et al. (submitted):

The best combination of possible climate policy options (mitigation, adaptation and different climate engineering technologies) to tackle climate change is unknown. Climate policy is facing a hard decision in answering the question if climate engineering technologies should be researched, limitedly deployed or even deployed at global scale. Such technologies bear large epistemological and ethical uncertainties and their use as well as non-use might have severe consequences. To deal with such uncertainties, (ethical) technology assessment should include the perspective of various stakeholders to combine diverse types of knowledge to inform climate policy. To facilitate (ethical) technology assessment, we propose in this article a methodology to collect and analyze data on ethical concerns and the acceptability of climate engineering technologies, whereby we focus only on Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) as an use case. We propose an innovative combination of newly developed methods consisting of two data collections tools (Cognitive-Affective Mapping and large-scale survey) and three types of data analyses (analyses of Cognitive-Affective Maps, analyses of survey data using factor analysis and cluster analytical procedures). Applying a multi-method approach we were able to identify (1) central ethical and governance related concerns regarding SAI (by Cognitive-Affective Maps), (2) to measure the relative importance of core constructs (positive and negative affect, risk and benefit perception, trust) on the acceptability of SAI and (3) to identify sub-groups of people (technology optimists and pessimists), which could be addressed differently by climate policy (by large-scale survey).
